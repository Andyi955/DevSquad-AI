### 📚 Research: Python Curses Best Practices & Cross-Platform Support

**Summary**: The `curses` module is the standard for terminal interfaces in Python, but it requires the `windows-curses` wrapper for Windows compatibility. Best practices involve using color pairs for styling and managing windows or sub-windows to optimize rendering and UI organization.

**Key Findings**:
1.  **Standardized Cross-Platform Approach**: The consensus across Stack Overflow and Reddit is that `windows-curses` is the most reliable method for Windows support. It allows developers to use the standard `import curses` syntax, ensuring that code written for Linux/macOS works on Windows with zero modifications to the logic.
2.  **Color Pair Architecture**: Unlike standard ANSI escape codes where foreground and background are set independently, `curses` requires defining `color_pair` objects. These are fixed combinations of foreground and background colors initialized at the start of the application.
3.  **Windowed Content & Optimization**: DZone highlights that for complex UIs (like a game with a sidebar), using `curses.newwin()` or sub-windows is more efficient than redrawing the entire `stdscr`. This allows for localized refreshes, reducing CPU usage and terminal flickering.

**Code Example**:
```python
import curses

def draw_ui(stdscr):
    # Initialize color pairs (Pair ID, Foreground, Background)
    curses.init_pair(1, curses.COLOR_CYAN, curses.COLOR_BLACK)
    
    # Create a sub-window for the game board (height, width, begin_y, begin_x)
    game_win = curses.newwin(20, 40, 1, 1)
    game_win.box() # Draw a border around the game area
    
    # Apply color pair to the window
    game_win.attron(curses.color_pair(1))
    game_win.addstr(1, 1, "Game Area Initialized")
    game_win.attroff(curses.color_pair(1))
    
    game_win.refresh()
    stdscr.getch()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    curses.wrapper(draw_ui)
```

**Recommendation**: Implement the game board using a dedicated `curses.newwin()` to separate the gameplay area from the score display. This will simplify coordinate management and rendering logic.

[CHECKLIST_UPDATE]
- [x] 2. Research terminal-based rendering techniques using curses or windows-curses for cross-platform compatibility (→RESEARCH)
[/CHECKLIST_UPDATE]

[→JUNIOR] You have the research on `curses` and window management. Proceed to implement the core game logic (`Snake` and `Food` classes). Ensure the logic uses a coordinate system (x, y) that can be easily mapped to the `curses` window coordinates.

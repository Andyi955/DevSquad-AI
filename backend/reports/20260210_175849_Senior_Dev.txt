THOUGHTS:

I need to see if `windows-curses` is included for cross-platform support as per the research.


RESPONSE:
I will begin by verifying the environment and then proceed to implement the UI rendering engine. Although `game_logic.py` was described in the previous turn, it is missing from the current file list, so I will ensure it is present before creating the main entry point.

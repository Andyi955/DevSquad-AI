THOUGHTS:

The user wants me to continue the "Colorful Terminal Snake Game" project.
Reviewing the current state:
- Step 1 (Setup) and Step 2 (Research) are complete.
- Step 3 (Core Logic) was marked as complete in the prompt's checklist, but `game_logic.py` is missing from the "Available Files" list.
- The previous conversation shows the Junior Dev claimed to have implemented it, but the code was not actually provided or saved to a file in the context.
- I cannot proceed to Step 4 (UI Rendering) without the underlying logic.

Plan:
1. Re-verify the existence of `game_logic.py` using `[READ_FILE]`.
2. If it doesn't exist, I will revert Step 3 to unchecked and delegate it back to the Junior Dev to actually create the file.
3. Once the logic is present, I will proceed with the UI.

Let's check for the file first.


RESPONSE:


[READ_FILE:game_logic.py]
[DONE]

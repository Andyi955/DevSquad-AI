THOUGHTS:

The user wants me to continue the "Colorful Terminal Snake Game" project.
I am the **Mission Architect** (Senior Developer Agent).

Current status:
- Step 1 (Setup): Done.
- Step 2 (Research): Done.
- Step 3 (Core Logic): Done.
- Step 4 (UI Rendering): Pending (Assigned to SENIOR - Me).
- Step 5 (Unit Tests): Pending (Assigned to TESTER).
- Step 6 (Verification): Pending (Assigned to SENIOR - Me).

The Junior Dev just finished `game_logic.py`. I need to read this file first to understand how to build the UI around it.

Plan:
1. Read `game_logic.py` to understand the API.
2. Implement the UI rendering engine in a new file (e.g., `main.py`) using `curses`.
3. Update the checklist.

Let's start by reading the logic file.


RESPONSE:


[READ_FILE:game_logic.py]
[DONE]

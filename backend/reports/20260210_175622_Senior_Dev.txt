Step 1 is complete. Moving to Step 2: Researching terminal-based rendering with curses.


RESPONSE:
[MISSION_CHECKLIST]
Mission: Colorful Terminal Snake Game
- [x] 1. Set up project directory, initialize a virtual environment (venv), and create requirements.txt (→JUNIOR)
- [ ] 2. Research terminal-based rendering techniques using curses or windows-curses for cross-platform compatibility (→RESEARCH)
- [ ] 3. Implement core game logic including Snake class, movement, food spawning, and collision detection (→JUNIOR)
- [ ] 4. Develop the terminal UI rendering engine with ANSI colors and non-blocking input handling (→SENIOR)
- [ ] 5. Write unit tests for game state logic (e.g., snake growth, wall collisions, self-collision) (→TESTER)
- [ ] 6. Run the snake game in the terminal to verify gameplay, colors, and performance (→SENIOR)
[/MISSION_CHECKLIST]



[→RESEARCH] Research the `curses` module in Python for terminal-based game development. 
Specifically:
1. How to handle cross-platform compatibility (Linux/macOS `curses` vs Windows `windows-curses`).
2. How to implement non-blocking input (getting key presses without pausing the game loop).
3. How to initialize and use ANSI colors within the `curses` environment.
4. Best practices for a game loop (refresh rates and screen clearing).
